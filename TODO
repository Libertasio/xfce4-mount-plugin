Have a look at the icon stuff: when changing from binary install to custom and thus from /usr to /ur/local, no image is shown at all; can't find the nice image in the filesystem easily

Add more translations from all over the world ;-)

To add your language, simply copy po/xfce4-mount-plugin.pot to 
po/languagecode.po and edit ALL the msgstr fields in your language with an 
UTF-8 capable editor. 

Try to also add your name and email to the information at the beginning of the 
file.

When you've finished translating, send the gzipped PO file to 
<timystery@arcor.de>.

Thanks, Fabian Nowak and all other users speaking your newly translated 
language!
